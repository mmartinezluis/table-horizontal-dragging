## Problem to Solve
Create a widget that allows scrolling horizontally within a table when the table width exceeds the viewport width that functions on click and mouse drag.


## Languages and Tools
The problem was solved using full-stack Ruby on Rails as the web framework, jQuery, and the jQuery-ui draggable module.

## Running the App
* Clone the repositoryo to your machine
```
git clone https://github.com/mmartinezluis/jquery-draggable.git
```
* Start the Rails server
```
rails s
```
* Go to `localhost:3000` in your browser, and play with the app
<!-- This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
