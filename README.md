## Problem to Solve
Create a widget that allows scrolling horizontally within a table when the table width exceeds the viewport width that functions on click and mouse drag.


## Languages and Tools
The problem was solved using full-stack Ruby on Rails as the web framework, jQuery for JavaScript manipulation, and the jQuery-ui draggable module. The widget code can be found in app/views/feature/_hor_scrolling.html.haml.
